# Implementer And Oracle Responsibility Boundary

Status: normative Oracle architecture and governance policy.

Source policy authority:

- repository: `/Users/me/wip-mach/wip-gpt`
- role-governance commit: `44035b603e8e6ba71faf7afb635d162d2bd18a09`
- source documents:
  - `docs/role-governance.md`
  - `docs/source-oracle-responsibility-boundary.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`

This Oracle policy adopts the source-side role governance and responsibility
boundary. Canonical role names and escalation rules are defined by source
`docs/role-governance.md` at the commit above. If an Oracle document or task
conflicts with this boundary, this boundary and the source role-governance
authority win and the conflicting work stops for review.

## Core Boundary

The rmxOS source repository is owned by the Implementer.

Oracle has read-only access to `/Users/me/wip-mach/wip-gpt`. Oracle must never create, modify, delete, move, stage, or commit files in the rmxOS source repository.

All rmxOS source-repository writes are performed by the Implementer, including:

- kernel, runtime, userland, library, daemon, and command implementation;
- build-system, source-transform, harness-link, guest-staging, and integration
  changes;
- source-side probes, fixtures, scripts, tests, and documentation;
- donor import, extraction, adaptation, and source-side provenance records;
- source-side authorization and architecture decisions.

This remains true when Oracle identifies the required change, supplies a
reproducer, or proposes an exact patch. Oracle reports the requirement; the
Implementer reviews and implements it.

Oracle may validate only committed source pins. Uncommitted source bytes must
not be used as accepted runtime, parity, or gate evidence.

## Oracle Ownership

Oracle owns testing, feature exploration, and gate authority inside the Oracle
repository. Oracle Explorer mode owns read-only exploration and host readiness.
Oracle Gatekeeper mode owns guest attempts, evidence dispositions, marker
authority, preserved evidence, and closeouts.

Oracle may create and modify, inside the Oracle repository:

- gate designs and dependency classifications;
- host-side test probes, fixtures, validation modules, and falsifiers;
- marker manifests, ordering contracts, producer attribution, and no-copy
  checks;
- guest-run orchestration and evidence collection;
- preserved evidence, revalidation logic, disposition records, and closeout
  records;
- source-readiness checks that fail closed when rmxOS implementation or staging
  support is missing.

Oracle may read rmxOS and donor source, build committed rmxOS source, run
committed source-side tools, and report precise source blockers. These actions
do not grant Oracle authority to modify the rmxOS repository.

Oracle test probes, fixtures, stubs, and validators must never substitute for
rmxOS product implementation. This sentence uses `validators` as a mechanism
term for validation modules and evidence checkers, not as the Validator role.
Harness behavior may prove orchestration, but it must not satisfy a
product/runtime claim.

## Escalation Rule

When Oracle finds missing or incorrect product/runtime behavior:

1. Oracle stops before modifying rmxOS source.
2. Oracle preserves evidence.
3. Report the smallest falsifiable source requirement.
4. The Implementer makes and commits the rmxOS change.
5. Oracle updates its explicit source pin and validates the committed change.

An Oracle authorization to test, build, stage, or run a committed source pin
does not authorize source-repository writes.

## Change Lanes

Full evidence ceremony applies to any change that touches runtime claims,
markers, attempt accounting, or evidence trees, regardless of file type. The
ceremony is activation record, Validator routing, Gatekeeper staging, and
attempt accounting.

Every other change, including docs, templates, and harness glue, lands as:
Implementer commit, one Arranger review, Coordinator acceptance. Validator
review is optional at Coordinator routing.

Ambiguity defaults to the evidence lane. Oracle Gatekeeper polices this
boundary and stops if a docs-lane or tooling-lane change alters a runtime
claim, marker, attempt account, or evidence tree.

Mechanical staging corrections during an activation may be fixed directly by
the Implementer and re-staged by Gatekeeper without an Arranger round trip.
This applies only to staging config, probe enable-lists, rc-entry
normalization, pin substitution, and harness-glue paths. It never includes
probe logic, marker emission, or expected-set definitions.

Gatekeeper duties for a mid-activation mechanical correction:

1. Verify the correction is logged in the governing record with a correction
   pin.
2. Count the correction against the current activation.
3. Re-stage from the corrected committed pin.
4. Treat the third stop in an activation as a full stop to the Arranger.

The record-reconciliation rule is unchanged: the committed activation or
amendment record outranks in-band assertions. If the committed record and the
in-band request disagree, Gatekeeper stops before spending a guest attempt.

## Doctrine Currency

Governance documents state only the current ruleset. Changing a rule replaces
its text; superseded rules are deleted and git history is the archive.

Event-specific material, including takeover narratives, activation routing,
and incident reports, belongs in activation records or run evidence, not in
rules documents.

Owner overrules are patched into doctrine immediately. They are not tracked as
pending governance state.

Removal rationale belongs in the commit message, not in the doctrine text.

## Repository Write And Access Policy

| Role | rmxOS source repository | Oracle repository | Evidence authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coordinator | parent-access exception authority; doctrine and scope decisions | parent-access exception authority | may require supersession, not silent rewrite |
| Arranger | no standing write authority | no standing write authority | none |
| Implementer | read/write; sole product implementation authority | docs-lane writes and mechanical staging corrections when routed or logged by rule | none |
| Oracle Explorer | read-only | read/write for host review and readiness work | no guest attempts or dispositions |
| Oracle Gatekeeper | read-only | read/write for guest evidence, marker authority, and closeouts | sole pass/fail disposition authority |
| Validator | no write authority | no write authority | none |
| Arbiter | no write authority | no write authority | cannot alter dispositions in either direction |

An explicit task authorization may permit Oracle to run a source-side command
or consume a committed source artifact. It does not permit Oracle to write to
the rmxOS source repository. Any exception to this boundary requires a separate
architecture decision that names the exact paths, duration, and reason.

Donor and reference repositories are read-only for all roles unless a separate
explicit decision authorizes maintenance.

Parent-access exceptions are governed by source `docs/role-governance.md`'s
one-way-door access rule. The one-way-window is read-only visibility; tree
position grants no repository writes by itself. Writable direct access requires
a recorded one-way-door exception.

Oracle worktree changes follow the change-lane rule in `AGENTS.md`. Pin fixes
are limited to making a pin match an already-committed record, such as typo or
path-class corrections. Repointing any evidence, authority, or authorization
pin to a different commit is excluded and goes through the normal Oracle
pin-update flow. Marker manifests, contract checks, falsifiers, and
evidence-validation modules are never mechanical staging corrections.

## Oracle Modes

Every Oracle output declares `mode: explorer` or `mode: gatekeeper`.

Explorer mode is read-only toward runtime evidence. Explorer outputs use this
vocabulary for gate and evidence-state assertions:

- ready;
- not ready;
- smallest source requirement;
- host readiness;
- suspected layer.

Explorer mode may inspect source, donor, build products, host preflight, and
preserved evidence. Explorer mode never runs a guest, never consumes attempts,
and never issues evidence dispositions.

Gatekeeper mode owns guest attempts, evidence, pass/fail dispositions, marker
authority, preserved evidence, and closeouts. Gatekeeper outputs use this
vocabulary for gate and evidence-state assertions:

- accepted;
- not accepted;
- consumed;
- disposition;
- marker authority;
- closeout.

Only Gatekeeper mode may consume or account guest attempts.

Gatekeeper also polices the change-lane boundary. If a requested docs-lane,
template, harness-glue, or mechanical correction is ambiguous, Gatekeeper
treats it as evidence-lane work until a governing record or Coordinator routing
states otherwise.

## Static Check

Run:

```text
mix oracle.source.boundary.check
```

The check:

- resolves an explicit source ref to a committed source commit;
- verifies source policy commit `44035b603e8e6ba71faf7afb635d162d2bd18a09`
  remains in the current source history;
- validates required boundary wording in Oracle governance documents;
- emits a read-only source-worktree fingerprint for before/after comparison.

The check does not require a clean source worktree and does not mutate it.
Agents must still compare source state before and after work and report any
unexpected difference.

## Review Guardrails

Every Oracle task must confirm:

- no rmxOS source-repository files were modified, deleted, staged, or
  committed;
- any source blocker is reported rather than repaired in Oracle;
- test scaffolds remain in Oracle and are not represented as rmxOS product
  implementation;
- source commit pins identify the exact rmxOS implementation under test.

Every Implementer task responding to Oracle must confirm:

- the source change is independently reviewed as rmxOS implementation;
- the change does not weaken Oracle pass/fail authority;
- Oracle can validate the committed source change without writing to the source
  repository.
